       SECURITY STRATEGY 

A security program is constantly evolving. It provides a mechanism for continuous improvement of security processes. As new technologies are developed and new attacks are discovered, the security policy provides a centralized place that policy and procedures can evolve as the threat level evolves.

For most companies information is a key asset, whether intellectual property such as product designs, customer data or client lists, or financial information. Information is critical to business success. Accidental or malicious loss of any of this information could expose the client, the business or both to significant loss to revenue and reputation.  A security strategy must address protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA) of assets.

These tactics are part of an effective security strategy:

Risk Analysis – Analyzing risk helps you determine your tolerance levels for risk and which you can accept, avoid, transfer, or prevent. Risk analysis can help determine how to best budget and prioritize security initiatives.
Classification of Data and Assets – It is necessary to understand the data and assets that your organization maintains, and classify based on importance to the core business objectives. This helps you set priorities for levels of security and set permissions for information access.
User Security Awareness Training – Without question, people pose the biggest threat to your organization via accidental or malicious misuse or abuse of data. Employees must be properly trained on the sensitivity of data, threats, and how to handle data appropriately. Employee awareness of company policy and procedures can certainly help prevent data loss.
Management Approval – Management approval and executive sponsorship is the most important factor in the success of a successful security program. Align your security strategy with business objectives to ensure management approval. This can lead to improved employee adherence to policies and increased security budgets leading to implementation of effective solutions that support the strategy.
